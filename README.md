A target DNA molecule of length 50,000 bp is digested into fragments.
All of the fragments have the same length equal to about 300 bp. 
There are 600 fragments in total. A python script was implemented to calculate the 
fraction fo the target molecul covered by at least 4 fragments using two methods.
